# Music Genre Classification using KNN

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that automatically classifies a given audio file into its respective music genre using the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm.
Automatic musical genre classification can supplement or replace the human user in this process, with an accuracy of 74% for ten musical genres using KNN. 
The accuracy of the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, to some degree, depends on the value of K. Generally speaking, using the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, the accuracy is around 70% after simulation. By adjusting the value of K, the accuracy can be improved on a small scale.
